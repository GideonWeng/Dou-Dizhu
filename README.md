# Dou Dizhu

One of the final projects of CS132 in ShanghaiTech University. Dou dizhu, one of the most popular card games played in China, developped by MATLAB (2019_a).   

Since the MATLAB is required by professor, I have to develop this app using a unfamiliar language. Though MATLAB does not a good choice for developing app, the appdesigner, a tool provided by MATLAB, is powerful in desihg and easy to use.  

**Note:** We have provided a complete documents(requirements, software specifications, validations, etc.) for this project, please check `<./docs>` first if you have any puzzles.

## Usage
1. In MATLAB, change current folder to the one _main.m_ is in.
2. Add `<./resourse>`, `<./resourse/cards>`, `<./resourse/audio_mat>` to your **MATLAB PATH**.
3. Have Fun!
   1. Type `main` in console **or** 
   2. Double click the file `main.m` and lick `Run` in the `Editor` Tab.
   
## Test
1. Copy all `<*.m>` files within `<./test>` to the main path. 
2. Any test file could be selected and run. Specially, the `<./test/ruleTest.m>` contains two complete games. If you run it, it will play two games automatically.

## Documentation
1. **Requirements**: All requirements of Dou Dizhu. This doc includes UML, rules, requirement prioritization, and etc. 
2. **Wiki:** Dowload from wikipedia, as reference.
3. **Specification:** Development details. If you hava any questions about implementation please refer to this. 
4. **Validation:** Test reports.
   
## TODO
Within the limited develop time, the app is not very complete. At present, the app can support play _Dou Dizhu_ in one PC. Following is TODO list. If you can contribute to this Repo, I'll be really appreciated. 
1. [ ] Log In
2. [ ] More voice effects during the playing: some audio files has put in `<./resourse/audio/>`.
