# Dou Dizhu

One of the final projects of CS132. Dou dizhu(a poker game) made by MATLAB(2019_a).   
Since the MATLAB is required by professor, I have to develop this app using a unfamiliar language. Though MATLAB does not a good choice for developing app, the appdesigner, a tool provided by MATLAB, is powerful in desigh and easy to use.  

**Note:** We have provided a complete documents(requirements, software specifications, validations e.t.c) for this project, please check `<./docs>` first if you have any puzzles.

2. add `<./resourse>`, `<./resourse/cards>`, `<./resourse/audio_mat>` to your **MATLAB PATH**.
3. Run:
